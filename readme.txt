This is a simple calculator app / web application.
It was made as a part of The Odin Project curriculum.

As usual, the curriculum gave us only frameworks of what do we have to do, all 
the functionality and JavaScript we had to figure out on our own.

Version 1:
- Created HTML and CSS.
- Added JS, calculator works with single-digit numbers.
- For now, 'clear' button is not functional.
- Calculator is capable of taking in single digit, then an operator and then
  another single digit, and when uses presses '=', the calculator returns
  value.
- Version 1 took about 2 hours to complete.
- The hardest part to figure out was how to collect and save the data in variables,
  the switches as a solution I found out on my own.
- We need the switches to disable event-listeners when we do not need them anymore.

Version 2:
- Added functionality to "back" and "clear" buttons
- Added "dot" button for decimals
- Upgraded the CSS a little bit, added animations to hovering over buttons
- Version 2 took about 3 hours to complete

Version 3:
- Added functionality to "dot" button in all steps
- Limiting the number of decimal dots on the screen to 1
- Added CSS media queries for mobile portrait-orientation friendly interface
- Fixed string to number converting
- Version 3 took about 4 hours to complete

Version 4:
- Added keyboard support
- Added additional styling for touch-events and for key-down events,
  so the user can see what is going on
- This version took about 3 hours to complete

Version 5:
- Added upper row in the display, to show the history of calculations
- Corrected CSS for touch-screens animations
- This version took about 2 hours to complete
